<h2>Description</h2>
Azure Active Directory (AD) is often a critical component in many cloud-based Azure solutions. With Azure AD you have a centralized identity and access management platform, which helps for much more than simply storing user details and credentials. In this lab, we'll walk through some of the very basic administration tasks that one may perform when managing user accounts within Azure AD.
<br />
<br />
Consider the following scenario:
<br />
You work as a senior systems administrator, and the management of Azure AD is one of your many responsibilities.
<br />
As a senior team member, it's also important that you share your knowledge with other colleagues.
<br />
Your manager has recently asked you to provide a walkthrough of basic user management tasks for a group of new Helpdesk team members.
<br />
Using an empty demonstration Azure AD tenant you have configured, you are going to demonstrate the following:
<br />
<br />
Creating a new user
<br />
Modifying existing user accounts
<br />
Revoking access for users
<br />
Deleting user accounts
<br />
